Still from [Heaven King video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBWrpVrazzA)

Repo that makes this site: <https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r>

Present and quite stable, goal is to stay very current:

  * Instructions for Git/GitHub/R/RStudio installation and set-up
  * Early and fundamental workflows using Git and GitHub with R and RStudio.
    - Including special tips for the effective use of R Markdown and the rmarkdown package with GitHub.

Present and still growing, within some limits:

  * More on Git itself. However we have no ambitions to be a full substitute for other comprehensive Git references.
  * Intermediate and advanced workflows, with a special emphasis on concerns relevant to useRs, data analysts, etc.
    
Present but stale / stalled.

  * Using GitHub to run a course.
