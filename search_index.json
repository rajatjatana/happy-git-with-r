Prompts for workshop activites. What is coming: More on Git itself, though will mostly rely on rest of the internet for that. I want to add / borrow / link to visual explanations. Workflows and policies for individuals and groups. How often should I commit? Which files should I commit? Data files and the dilemmas they present. Most common Git predicaments. How to avoid and recover. Clone vs fork. Purpose of branches, issues, pull requests, tags. Add-as-collaborator vs “fork and pull”. Use of the GitHub API for bulk operations. Using GitHub to run a course. Get an Organization. Use of Teams, repos, issues, pushing content into repos.

Why GitHub? 1.1 Why Git? 1.2 Why GitHub? 1.3 Is it going to hurt? 1.4 What is the payoff? 1.5 Who can do what? 1.6 Special features of GitHub 1.7 What’s special about using R and with Git and GitHub? 1.8 Audience and pre-reqs 1.9 What this is NOT", " 1 Why Git? Why GitHub? Why would a data analyst use hosted version control? 1.1 Why Git? Git is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files – called a repository – in a sane, highly structured way. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, think of it as the “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word on steroids. Git has been re-purposed by the data science community. In addition to using it for source code, we use it to manage the motley collection of files that make up typical data analytical projects, which often consist of data, figures, reports, and, yes, source code. A solo data analyst, working on a single computer, will benefit from adopting version control. But not nearly enough to justify the pain of installation and workflow upheaval. There are much easier ways ways to get versioned back ups of your files, if that’s all you’re worried about. In my opinion, for new users, the pros of Git only outweigh the cons when you factor in the overhead of communicating and collaborating with other people. Who among us does not need to do that? Your life is much easier if this is baked into your workflow, as opposed to being a separate process that you dread or neglect. 1.2 Why GitHub? This is where hosting services like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab come in. They provide a home for your Git-based projects on the internet. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, think of it as DropBox but much, much better. The remote host acts as a distribution channel or clearinghouse for your Git-managed project. It allows other people to see your stuff, sync up with you, and perhaps even make changes. These hosting providers improve upon traditional Unix Git servers with well-designed web-based interfaces. Even for private solo projects, it’s a good idea to push your work to a remote location for peace of mind. Why? Because it’s fairly easy to screw up your local Git repository, especially when you’re new at this. The good news is that often only the Git infrastructure is borked up. Your files are just fine! Which makes your Git pickle all the more frustrating. There are official Git solutions to these problems, but they might require expertise and patience you can’t access at 3a.m. If you’ve recently pushed your work to GitHub, it’s easy to grab a fresh copy, patch things up with the changes that only exist locally, and get on with your life. We target GitHub – not Bitbucket or GitLab – for the sake of specificity. However, all the big-picture principles and even some mechanics will carry over to these alternative hosting platforms. Don’t get too caught up on public versus private at this point. There are many ways to get private repositories from the major providers for low or no cost. Just get started and figure out if and how Git/GitHub is going to work for you! If you outgrow this arrangement, you can throw some combination of technical savvy and money at the problem. You can either pay for a higher level of service or self-host one of these platforms. 1.3 Is it going to hurt? Yes. You have to install Git, get local Git talking to GitHub, and make sure RStudio can talk to local Git (and, therefore, GitHub). This is one-time or once-per-computer pain. For new or existing projects, you will: Dedicate a directory (a.k.a “folder”) to it. Make it an RStudio Project. Make it a Git repository. Go about your usual business. But instead of only saving individual files, periodically you make a commit, which takes a multi-file snapshot of the entire project. Have you ever versioned a file by adding your initials or the date? That is effectively a commit, albeit only for a single file: it is a version that is significant to you and that you might want to inspect or revert to later. Push commits to GitHub periodically. This is like sharing a document with colleagues on DropBox or sending it out as an email attachment. It signals you’re ready to make your work visible to others and invite comment or edits. This is a change to your normal, daily workflow. It feels weird at first but quickly becomes second nature. FWIW, STAT 545 students are required to submit all coursework via GitHub. This is a major topic in class and office hours for the first two weeks. Then we practically never discuss it again. More bad news. The STAT 545 pain is short-lived because students primarily work in their own repositories. Do you use GitHub to work with other people or to coordinate your own work from multiple computers? If so, after you recover from the initial setup, Git will crush you again with merge conflicts. And this is not one-time pain, this could be a dull ache for a long time. The best remedy is prevention, but also understanding how to back out of tricky situations and tackle them on your own terms. The rest of this site is dedicated to walking you through the necessary setup and creating your first few Git projects. We conclude with prompts that guide you through some of the more advanced usage that makes all of this initial pain worthwhile. 1.4 What is the payoff? Exposure: If someone needs to see your work or if you want them to try out your code, they can easily get it from GitHub. If they use Git, they can clone or fork your repository. If they don’t use Git, they can still browse your project on GitHub like a normal website and even grab everything by downloading a zip archive. Be a keener! If you care deeply about someone else’s project, such as an R package you use heavily, you can track its development on GitHub. You can watch the repository to get notified of major activity. You can fork it to keep your own copy. You can modify your fork to add features or fix bugs and send them back to the owner as a proposed change. Collaboration: If you need to collaborate on data analysis or code development, then everyone should use Git. Use GitHub as your clearinghouse: individuals work independently, then send work back to GitHub for reconciliation and transmission to the rest of the team. The advantage of Git/GitHub is highlighted by comparing these two ways of collaborating on a document: Edit, save, attach. In this workflow, everyone has one (or more!) copies of the document and they circulate via email attachment. Which one is “master”? Is it even possible to say? How do different versions relate to each other? How should versions be reconciled? If you want to see the current best version, how do you get it? All of this usually gets sorted out by social contract and a fairly manual process. Google Doc. In this workflow, there is only one copy of the document and it lives in the cloud. Anyone can access the most recent version on demand. Anyone can edit or comment or propose a change and this is immediately available to everyone else. Anyone can see who’s been editing the document and, if disaster strikes, can revert to a previous version. A great deal of ambiguity and annoying reconciliation work has been designed away. Managing a project via Git/GitHub is much more like the Google Doc scenario and enjoys many of the same advantages. It is definitely more complicated than collaborating on a Google Doc, but this puts you in the right mindset. 1.5 Who can do what? A public repository is readable by the world. The owner can grant higher levels of permission to others, such as the ability to push commits. A private repository is invisible to the world. The owner can grant read, write (push), or admin access to others. There is also a formal notion of an organization, which can be useful for managing repository permissions for entire teams of people. 1.6 Special features of GitHub this is perhaps too detailed … full stop? or does it belong elsewhere? In addition to a well-designed user interface, GitHub offers two especially important features: Issues. Remember how we’re high-jacking software development tools? Well, this is the bug tracker. It’s a list of things … bugs, feature requests, to dos, whatever. Issues are tightly integrated with email and therefore allow you to copy/embed important conversations in the associated repo. Issues can be assigned to people (e.g., to dos) and tagged (“bug” or “progress-report”). Issues are tightly integrated with commits and therefore allow you to record that the changes in this commit solve that problem which was discussed in that issue. As a new user of GitHub, one of the most productive things you can do is to use GitHub issues to provide a clear bug report or feature request for a package you use. Pull requests. Git allows a project to have multiple, independent branches of development, with the notion that some should eventually be merged back into the main development branch. These are technical Git terms but hopefully also make sense on their own. A pull request is a formal proposal that says: “Here are some changes I would like to make.” It might be linked to a specific issue: “Related to #14.” or “Fixes #56”. GitHub facilitates and preserves the discussion of the proposal, holistically and line-by-line. 1.7 What’s special about using R and with Git and GitHub? The active R package development community on GitHub. Read about R-specific GitHub resources and searching here. Specific workflows make it rewarding to share source code, rendered reports, and entire projects. Read more about R Markdown, R scripts, and R-heavy projects. Git- and GitHub-related features of the RStudio IDE. This is covered throughout. 1.8 Audience and pre-reqs The target audience for this site is someone who analyzes data, probably with R, though some of the content may be useful to analysts using other languages. R package development with Git(Hub) is absolutely in scope, but it is not an explicit focus or requirement. The site is aimed at intermediate to advanced R users, who are comfortable writing R scripts and managing R projects. You should have a good grasp of files and directories and be generally knowledgeable about where things live on your computer. Although we will show alternatives for most Git operations, we will inevitably spend some time in the shell and we assume some prior experience. For example, you should know how to open up a shell, navigate to a certain directory, and list the files there. You should be comfortable using shell commands to view/move/rename files and to work with your command history. 1.9 What this is NOT We aim to teach novices about Git on a strict “need to know” basis. Git was built to manage development of the Linux kernel, which is probably very different from what you do. Most people need a small subset of Git’s functionality and that will be our focus. If you want a full-blown exposition of Git as a directed acyclic graph or a treatise on the Git-Flow branching strategy, you will be sad. "],

Except your username. You might want to give that some thought. A few tips, which sadly tend to contradict each other: Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember. Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that. Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss. Shorter is better than longer. Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames. Make it timeless.

["install-git.html", "7 Install Git 7.1 Git already installed? 7.2 Windows 7.3 Mac OS 7.4 Linux", " 7 Install Git You need Git, so you can use it at the command line and so RStudio can call it. If there’s any chance it’s installed already, verify that, rejoice, and skip this step. Otherwise, find installation instructions below for your operating system. 7.1 Git already installed? Go to the shell (Appendix A). Enter which git to request the path to your Git exectuable which git ## /usr/bin/git and git --version to see its version. git --version ## git version 1.8.5.6 If you are successful, that’s great! You have Git already. No need to install! Move on. If, instead, you see something more like git: command not found, keep reading. Mac OS users might get an immediate offer to install command line developer tools. Yes, you should accept! Click “Install” and read more below. 7.2 Windows Option 1 (recommended): Install Git for Windows, previously known as msysgit or “Git Bash”, to get Git in addition to some other useful tools, such as the Bash shell. Yes, all those names are totally confusing. You may accept all the default settings during installation. This approach leaves the Git executable in a conventional location, which will help you and other programs, e.g. RStudio, find it and use it. This also supports a transition to more expert use, because the Bash shell will be useful as you venture outside of R/RStudio. This also leaves you with a Git client, though not a very good one. So check out Git clients we recommend (chapter 9). Option 2 (NOT recommended): The GitHub hosting site offers GitHub Desktop for Windows that provides Git itself, a client, and smooth integration with GitHub. Their Windows set-up instructions recommend this method of Git installation. Why don’t we like it? We’ve seen GitHub Desktop for Windows lead to Git installation in suboptimal locations, such as ~/AppData/Local, and in other places we could never find. If you were only going to interact with GitHub via this app, maybe that’s OK, but that does not apply to you. Therefore, we recommend option 1 instead. 7.3 Mac OS Option 1 (highly recommended): Install the Xcode command line tools (not all of Xcode), which includes Git. If your OS is older than 10.11 El Capitan, it is possible that you must install the Xcode command line tools in order for RStudio to find and use Git. Go to the shell and enter one of these commands to elicit an offer to install developer command line tools: git --version git config Accept the offer! Click on “Install”. Another way to request this is via xcode-select --install. We just happen to find this Git-based trigger apropos. Option 2 (recommended): Install Git from here: http://git-scm.com/downloads. This arguably sets you up the best for the future. It will certainly get you the latest version of Git of all approaches described here. The GitHub home for this project is here: https://github.com/timcharper/git_osx_installer. At that link, there is a list of maintained builds for various combinations of Git and Mac OS version. If you’re running 10.7 Lion and struggling, we’ve had success in September 2015 with binaries found here: https://www.wandisco.com/git/download. Option 3 (recommended): If you anticipate getting heavily into scientific computing, you’re going to be installing and updating lots of software. You should check out homebrew, “the missing package manager for OS X”. Among many other things, it can install Git for you. Once you have Homebrew installed, do this in the shell: brew install git Option 4 (NOT recommended): The GitHub hosting site offers GitHub Desktop for Mac that provides the option to install Git itself, a client, and smooth integration with GitHub.. Their Mac set-up instructions recommend this method of Git installation. We don’t like GitHub Desktop as a Git client, so this is a very cumbersome way to install Git. Consider this option a last resort. 7.4 Linux Install Git via your distro’s package manager.

["git-client.html", "9 Install a Git client 9.1 What and why 9.2 A picture is worth a thousand words 9.3 Recommended Git clients", " 9 Install a Git client This is optional but highly recommended. Unless specified, it is not required for live workshops and will not be explicitly taught, though you might see us using one of these clients. 9.1 What and why Learning to use version control can be rough at first. I found the use of a GUI – as opposed to the command line – extremely helpful when I was getting started. I call this sort of helper application a Git client. It’s really a Git(Hub) client because they also help you interact with GitHub or other remotes. Git and your Git client are not the same thing, just like R and RStudio are not the same thing. A Git client and the RStudio IDE are not necessary to use to Git or R, respectively, but they make the experience more pleasant because they reduce the amount of command line bullshittery. RStudio offers a very basic Git client. I use this often for simple operations, but you probably want another, more powerful one as well. Fair warning: for some things, you will have to use the command line. But the more powerful your Git client is, the less often this happens. Fantastic news: because all of the clients are just forming and executing Git commands on your behalf, you don’t have to pick one. You can literally do one operation from the command line, do another from RStudio, and another from SourceTree, one after the other, and it just works. Very rarely, both clients will scan the repo at the same time and you’ll get an error message about .git/index.lock. Try the operation again at least once before doing any further troubleshooting. 9.2 A picture is worth a thousand words Here’s a screenshot of SourceTree (see below) open to the repository for this site. You get a nice graphical overview of the recent commit history, branches, and diffs, as well as a GUI that facilitates the most common Git operations. SourceTree screenshot In contrast, here’s a shell session where I’ve used command line Git to access some of the same information. Command line Git Which do you prefer? 9.3 Recommended Git clients SourceTree is a free, powerful Git(Hub) client that I highly recommend. It was my first Git client and is still my favorite for nontrivial Git tasks. Available for Mac and Windows. If I’m teaching you in a course or workshop, you might see me using this. GitKraken is quite new on the scene and is free. I would probably start here if I was starting today. Why? Because it works across all three OSes my students use: Windows, Mac, and Linux. I hear very good reviews, especially from long-suffering Linux users who haven’t had any great options until now. GitUp is a free, open source client for Mac OS. I’ve heard really good things about it and like what I read on the website. However, I tried to make myself use it for a day and went sort of nuts, possibly because I’m so used to SourceTree. YMMV. GitHub also offers a free Git(Hub) client for Windows and Mac. We do NOT recommend it for Windows and have serious reservations even for Mac OS. What do we object to? The degree of hand-holding offered by GitHub’s clients borders on hand-cuffs. The Windows client sometimes leaves the Git executable so well hidden that we can’t find it. This is a deal-killer, because that means RStudio can’t find it either. These clients wrap Git functionality so thoroughly that we’ve had students make some destructive mistakes. For example, we’ve seen a “sync” operation that resulted in the loss of local uncommitted changes. Exactly which Git operations, in what order, are implied by “sync”, is not entirely clear. We prefer clients that expose Git more explicitly. We’ve heard similar negative reviews from other instructors. It’s not just us. Others that I have heard positive reviews for: SmartGit git-cola magit, for Emacs nerds Browse even more Git(Hub) clients. "],

I assume we’re still viewing your new GitHub repo. Refresh. You should see the new “A line I wrote on my local computer” in the README. If you click on “commits,” you should see one with the message “A commit from my local computer.” If you have made it this far, you are ready to graduate to using Git and GitHub with RStudio (chapter 13). But first … 10.5 Am I really going to type GitHub username and password on each push? It is likely that your first push, above, leads to a challenge for your GitHub username and password. This will drive you crazy in the long-run and make you reluctant to push. Do one of the follow to eliminate this annoyance: Credential caching for HTTPS access, chapter 11. Set up SSH keys, chapter 12. Now is the perfect time to do this, since you have a functioning test repo. 10.6 Clean up Local When you’re ready to clean up, you delete the local repo any way you like. It’s just a regular directory on your computer. Here’s how to do that in the shell, if current working directory is myrepo: cd .. rm -rf myrepo/ GitHub In the browser, go to your repo’s landing page on GitHub. Click on “Settings”. Scroll down, click on “delete repository,” and do as it asks. "],

You’ll need to set this up on each computer you want to connect to GitHub from. I do not explain all the shell and Git commands in detail. This is a black box diagnostic / configuration exercise. 11.1 Get a test repository You need a functioning test Git repository. One that exists locally and remotely on GitHub, with the local repo tracking the remote. If you have just verified that you can interact with GitHub (chapter 10) from your local computer, that test repo will be perfect. If you have just verified that you can work with GitHub from RStudio (chapter 13), that test repo will also be perfect. You may proceed when You have a test repo. You know where it lives on your local computer. Example: /home/jenny/tmp/myrepo You know where it lives on GitHub. Example: https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo You know local is tracking remote. In a shell with working directory set to the local Git repo, enter: git remote -v Output like this confirms that fetch and push are set to remote URLs that point to your GitHub repo: origin https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo (fetch) origin https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo (push) Now enter: git branch -vv Here we confirm that the local master branch has your GitHub master branch (origin/master) as upstream remote. Gibberish? Just check that your output looks similar to mine: master b8e03e3 [origin/master] line added locally 11.2 Verify that your Git is new enough to have a credential helper In a shell, do: git --version and verify your version is 1.7.10 or newer. If not, update Git (chapter 7) or use SSH keys (chapter 12). 11.3 Turn on the credential helper 11.3.0.1 Windows In the shell, enter: git config --global credential.helper wincred 11.3.0.2 Windows, plan B If that doesn’t seem to work, install an external credential helper. Download the git-credential-winstore.exe application. Run it! It should work if Git is in your PATH environment variable. If not, go to the directory where you downloaded the application and run the following: git-credential-winstore -i &quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin\\git.exe&quot; 11.3.0.3 Mac Find out if the credential helper is already installed. In the shell, enter: git credential-osxkeychain And look for this output: usage: git credential-osxkeychain &lt;get|store|erase&gt; If you don’t get this output, it means you need a more recent version of Git, either via command line developer tools or Homebrew. Go back to the Mac section of chapter (7). Once you’ve confirmed you have the credential helper, enter: git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain 11.3.0.4 Linux In the shell, enter: git config --global credential.helper &#39;cache --timeout=10000000&#39; to store your password for ten million seconds or around 16 weeks, enough for a semester. 11.3.1 Trigger a username / password challenge Change a file in your local repo and commit it. Do that however you wish. Here are shell commands that will work: echo &quot;adding a line&quot; &gt;&gt; README.md git add -A git commit -m &quot;A commit from my local computer&quot; Now push! git push -u origin master One last time you will be asked for your username and password, which hopefully will be cached. Now push AGAIN. git push You should NOT be asked for your username and password, instead you should see Everything up-to-date. Rejoice and close the shell. "],
["ssh-keys.html", "12 Set up keys for SSH 12.1 SSH keys 12.2 Check for existing keys 12.3 Set up from RStudio 12.4 Set up from the shell", " 12 Set up keys for SSH If you plan to push/pull using SSH, you need to set up SSH keys. You want to do this (or cache your username and password, chapter 11), so you don’t have to authenticate yourself interactively with GitHub over and over again. You’ll need to set this up on each computer you want to connect to GitHub from. 12.1 SSH keys SSH keys provide a more secure way of logging into a server than using a password alone. While a password can eventually be cracked with a brute force attack, SSH keys are nearly impossible to decipher by brute force alone. Generating a key pair provides you with two long string of characters: a public and a private key. You can place the public key on any server, and then unlock it by connecting to it with a client that already has the private key. When the two match up, the system unlocks without the need for a password. You can increase security even more by protecting the private key with a passphrase. Adapted from instructions provided by GitHub and Digital Ocean. 12.2 Check for existing keys Go to the shell (appendix A). List existing keys (at least, those in the default location): ls -al ~/.ssh If you are told .ssh doesn’t exist, you don’t have SSH keys! Keep reading to create them. If you see a pair of files like id_rsa.pub and id_rsa, you have a key pair already. You can skip to the section about adding a key to the ssh-agent. 12.3 Set up from RStudio Instructions for setting up SSH keys from RStudio are given in the Git and GitHub chapter of Wickham’s R packages book. Look at the end of the section on initial set up: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#git-init 12.4 Set up from the shell 12.4.1 Create SSH key pair Create the key pair by entering this, but substitute the email address associated with your GitHub account: $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;jenny@stat.ubc.ca&quot; Accept the proposal to save the key in the default location, i.e., just press Enter here: Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/jenny/.ssh/id_rsa): You have the option to protect the key with a passphrase. If you take it, you will want to configure something called the ssh-agent to manage this for you (more below). So either enter a passphrase (and store in your favorite password manager!) or decline by leaving this empty. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): The process should complete now and should have looked like this: jenny@2015-mbp ~ $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;jenny@stat.ubc.ca&quot; Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/jenny/.ssh/id_rsa): Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in /Users/jenny/.ssh/id_rsa.

Open ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in an editor and copy the contents to your clipboard or do one of the following at the command line: Mac OS: pbcopy &lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Windows: clip &lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Linux: xclip -sel clip &lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Linux: if needed, install via apt-get or yum.

Assuming that you’ve gotten local Git to talk to GitHub, this means you’ll also be able to pull from and push to GitHub from RStudio. In later chapters and in live workshops˜, we revisit these operations with much more explanation. If you succeed here, your set up is DONE. 13.1 Prerequisites We assume the following: You’ve registered a free GitHub account (chapter 5). You’ve installed/updated R and RStudio (chapter 6). You’ve installed Git (chapter 7). You’ve introduced yourself to Git (chapter 8). You’ve confirmed that you can push to / pull from GitHub from the command line (chapter 10). 13.2 Make a new repo on GitHub Go to https://github.com and make sure you are logged in. Click green “New repository” button. Or, if you are on your own profile page, click on “Repositories”, then click the green “New” button. Repository name: myrepo (or whatever you wish, we will delete this) Public YES Initialize this repository with a README Click big green button “Create repository.” Copy the HTTPS clone URL to your clipboard via the green “Clone or Download” button. Or copy the SSH URL if you chose to set up SSH keys. 13.3 Clone the new GitHub repository to your computer via RStudio In RStudio, start a new Project: File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git. In the “repository URL” paste the URL of your new GitHub repository. It will be something like this https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git. Do you NOT see an option to get the Project from Version Control? Go to chapter 14 for tips on how to help RStudio find Git. Take charge of – or at least notice! – the local directory for the Project. A common rookie mistake is to have no idea where you are saving files or what your working directory is. Pay attention. Be intentional. Personally, I would do this in ~/tmp. I suggest you check “Open in new session”, as that’s what you’ll usually do in real life. Click “Create Project”. This should download the README.md file that we created on GitHub in the previous step. Look in RStudio’s file browser pane for the README.md file. 13.4 Make local changes, save, commit From RStudio, modify the README.md file, e.g., by adding the line “This is a line from RStudio”. Save your changes. Commit these changes to your local repo. How? From RStudio: Click the “Git” tab in upper right pane. Check “Staged” box for README.md. If you’re not already in the Git pop-up, click “Commit”. Type a message in “Commit message”, such as “Commit from RStudio”. Click “Commit”. 13.5 Push your local changes online to GitHub Click the green “Push” button to send your local changes to GitHub. If you are challenged for username and password, provide them (but see below). You should see some message along these lines. [master dc671f0] blah 3 files changed, 22 insertions(+) create mode 100644 .gitignore create mode 100644 myrepo.Rproj 13.6 Confirm the local change propagated to the GitHub remote Go back to the browser. I assume we’re still viewing your new GitHub repo. Refresh. You should see the new “This is a line from RStudio” in the README. If you click on “commits,” you should see one with the message “Commit from RStudio”. If you have made it this far, you are DONE with set up. But first … 13.7 Were you challenged for GitHub username and password? If you somehow haven’t done so yet, now is the perfect time to make sure you don’t need to keep providing username and password on each push. Pick one: Credential caching for HTTPS access, chapter 11. Set up SSH keys, chapter 12. Now is the perfect time to do this, since you have a functioning test repo. 13.8 Clean up Local When you’re ready to clean up, you delete the local repo any way you like. It’s just a regular directory on your computer. GitHub In the browser, go to your repo’s landing page on GitHub. Click on “Settings”. Scroll down, click on “delete repository,” and do as it asks. "],

This often “just works”, so this page is aimed at people who have reason to suspect they have a problem. This is something you set up once-per-computer. 14.1 Do you have a problem? Let’s check if RStudio can find the Git executable. File &gt; New Project… Do you see an option to create from Version Control? If yes, good. Select New Directory &gt; Empty Project. Do you see a checkbox “Create a git repository”? If yes, good, CHECK IT. Give this disposable test project a name and click Create Project. Do you see a “Git” tab in the upper right pane, the same one that has “Environment” and “History”? If yes, good. If all looks good, you can delete this project. Looks like RStudio and Git are talking to each other. Keep reading if things don’t go so well or you want to know more. 14.2 Find Git yourself RStudio can only act as a GUI front-end for Git if Git has been successfully installed (chapter 7) AND RStudio can find it. A basic test for successful installation of Git is to simply enter git in the shell. If you get a complaint about Git not being found, it means installation was unsuccessful or that it is not being found, i.e. it is not on your PATH. If you are not sure where the Bit executable lives, try this in a shell: which git (Mac, Linux) where git (most versions of Windows) 14.3 Tell RStudio where to find Git If Git appears to be installed and findable, launch RStudio. Quit and re-launch RStudio if there’s any doubt in your mind about whether you opened RStudio before or after installing Git. Don’t make me stop this car and restart RStudio for you in office hours. DO IT. From RStudio, go to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN and make sure that the box Git executable points to … the Git executable. It should read something like: /usr/bin/git (Mac, Linux) C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/git.exe (Windows) Here is a screenshot of someone doing this on a Windows machine. WARNING: On Windows, do NOT use C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/cmd/git.exe. bin in the path is GOOD YES! cmd in the path is BAD NO! WARNING: On Windows, do NOT use git-bash.exe. Something that ends in git.exe is GOOD YES! git-bash.exe is BAD NO! At times, we’ve had trouble navigating to the necessary directory on Mac OS, once we’ve clicked “Browse” and are working with a Finder-type window. The keyboard shortcut “command + shift + g” will summon “Go To Folder”, where you will be able type or paste any path you want. Restart RStudio if you make any changes. Don’t make me stop this car again and restart RStudio for you in office hours. DO IT. Do the steps at the top of the page to see if RStudio and git are communicating now. No joy? I’ve seen this help: With your Project open, go to Tools &gt; Project Options.... If available, click on “Git/SVN” and select “Git” in the Version control system dropdown menu.

If you experience some new problem and, especially, find the corresponding solution, we’d love to hear from you! 15.1 I think I have installed Git but damn if I can find it When you install Git, try to control or record where it is being installed! Make a mental or physical note of these things. You may be able to find Git after the fact with these commands in the shell: which git (Mac, Linux, or anything running a bash shell) where git (Windows, when not in a bash shell) It is not entirely crazy to just re-install Git, using a method that leaves it in a more conventional location, and to pay very close attention to where it’s being installed. Live and learn. 15.2 Dysfunctional PATH I’m pretty sure that most cases of RStudio not automatically detecting the Git executable stem from problems with PATH. This is the set of directories where your computer will look for executables, such as Git (today) or make (later in this course). Certain methods of Git installation, especially on Windows and/or older OSes, have a higher tendency to put Git in an unconventional location or to fail to add the relevant directory to PATH. How to see your PATH? In the shell: echo $PATH Take a good hard look at this. See the point above about finding your Git executable or re-installing it while you are wide awake. Is the host directory in your PATH? No? Fix that. Go here for instructions on what to put in your .bash_profile in order to add a directory to PATH. 15.3 Push/Pull buttons greyed out in RStudio Are you sure your local repository is tracking a remote repository, e.g. a GitHub repo? In a shell with working directory set to the local Git repo, enter these commands: jenny@2015-mbp myrepo $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo (fetch) origin https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo (push) jenny@2015-mbp myrepo $ git branch -vv * master b8e03e3 [origin/master] line added locally We want to see that fetch and push are set to remote URLs that point to the remote repo. We also want to see that your local master branch has your GitHub master branch as upstream remote. If you discover you still need to set a remote, go to the shell and get into the working directory of the RStudio Project and Git repo of interest. Initiate the “upstream” or “tracking” relationship by adding a remote. Substitute the HTTPS URL for your GitHub repo. git remote add origin https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git Download all the files from the online GitHub repository and deal with any conflicts. git pull origin master Cement the tracking relationship between your GitHub repository and the local repo by pushing and setting the “upstream” remote: git push -u origin master 15.4 I have no idea if my local repo and my remote repo are connected. See the above section on “Push/Pull buttons greyed out in RStudio.” 15.5 Push fail at the RStudio level Do you get this error in RStudio? error: unable to read askpass response from &#39;rpostback-askpass&#39; Open the shell: Tools &gt; Shell. git push -u origin master 15.6 Push rejected, i.e. fail at the Git/GitHub level You might have changes on the remote AND on your local repo. Just because you don’t remember making any edits in the browser doesn’t mean you didn’t. Humor me. Pull first. Resolve any conflicts. Then try your push again. 15.7 RStudio is not making certain files available for staging/committing Do you have a space in your directory or file names? A space in a file name is a space in your soul. Get rid of it. Is your Git repo / RStudio Project inside a folder that … eventually rolls up to Google Drive, DropBox, Microsoft OneDrive, or a network drive? If yes, I recommend you move the repo / Project into a plain old directory that lives directly on your computer and that is not managed by, e.g., Google Drive. If you cannot deal with the two root causes identified above, then it is possible that a more powerful Git client (chapter 9) will be able to cope with these situations. But I make no promises. You should also try Git operations from the command line. 15.8 I hear you have some Git repo inside your Git repo Do not create a Git repository inside another Git repository. Just don’t. If you have a genuine need for this, which is really rare, the proper way to do is is via submodules. In STAT 545, we certainly do not need to do this and when we’ve seen it, it’s been a mistake. This has resulted in the unexpected and complete loss of the inner Git repository. To be sure, there was more going on here (cough, GitHub Desktop client), but non-standard usage of Git repos makes it much easier to make costly mistakes. "],

Why do we prefer this? Because this method of copying the Project from GitHub to your computer also sets up the local Git repository for immediate pulling and pushing. Under the hood, we are doing git clone. You’ve actually done this before during set up (chapter 13). We’re doing it again, with feeling. 16.1 Make a repo on GitHub Do this once per new project. Go to https://github.com and make sure you are logged in. Click green “New repository” button. Or, if you are on your own profile page, click on “Repositories”, then click the green “New” button. Repository name: myrepo (or whatever you wish) Public YES Initialize this repository with a README Click big green button “Create repository.” Copy the HTTPS clone URL to your clipboard via the green “Clone or Download” button. Or copy the SSH URL if you chose to set up SSH keys. 16.2 New RStudio Project via git clone In RStudio, start a new Project: File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git. In the “repository URL” paste the URL of your new GitHub repository. It will be something like this https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git. Be intentional about where you create this Project. Suggest you “Open in new session”. Click “Create Project” to create a new directory, which will be all of these things: a directory or “folder” on your computer a Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository an RStudio Project In the absence of other constraints, I suggest that all of your R projects have exactly this set-up. This should download the README.md file that we created on GitHub in the previous step. Look in RStudio’s file browser pane for the README.md file. There’s a big advantage to the “GitHub first, then RStudio” workflow: the remote GitHub repo is now the “upstream” remote for your local repo. This is a technical but important point about Git. The practical implication is that you are now set up to push and pull. No need to fanny around setting up Git remotes on the command line or in another Git client. 16.3 Make local changes, save, commit Do this every time you finish a valuable chunk of work, probably many times a day. From RStudio, modify the README.md file, e.g., by adding the line “This is a line from RStudio”. Save your changes. Commit these changes to your local repo. How? Click the “Git” tab in upper right pane Check “Staged” box for any files whose existence or modifications you want to commit. To see more detail on what’s changed in file since the last commit, click on “Diff” for a Git pop-up If you’re not already in the Git pop-up, click “Commit” Type a message in “Commit message”, such as “Commit from RStudio”. Click “Commit” 16.4 Push your local changes to GitHub Do this a few times a day, but possibly less often than you commit. You have new work in your local Git repository, but the changes are not online yet. This will seem counterintuitive, but first let’s stop and pull from GitHub. Why? Establish this habit for the future! If you make changes to the repo in the browser or from another machine or (one day) a collaborator has pushed, you will be happier if you pull those changes in before you attempt to push. Click the blue “Pull” button in the “Git” tab in RStudio. I doubt anything will happen, i.e. you’ll get the message “Already up-to-date.” This is just to establish a habit.

I assume we’re still viewing your new GitHub repo. Refresh. You should see the new “This is a line from RStudio” in the README. If you click on “commits,” you should see one with the message “Commit from RStudio”. 16.6 Make a change on GitHub Click on README.md in the file listing on GitHub. In the upper right corner, click on the pencil for “Edit this file”. Add a line to this file, such as “Line added from GitHub.” Edit the commit message in “Commit changes” or accept the default. Click big green button “Commit changes.” 16.7 Pull from GitHub Back in RStudio locally … Inspect your README.md. It should NOT have the line “Line added from GitHub”. It should be as you left it. Verify that. Click the blue Pull button. Look at README.md again. You should now see the new line there. 16.8 The end Now just … repeat. Do work somewhere. Commit it.

Click “Create Project” to create a new directory, which will be all of these things: a directory or “folder” on your computer a Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository an RStudio Project This should download the README.md file that we created on GitHub in the previous step. Look in RStudio’s file browser pane for the README.md file. 17.3 Bring your existing project over Using your favorite method of moving or copying files, copy the files that constitute your existing project into the directory for this new project. In RStudio, consult the Git pane and the file browser. Are you seeing all the files? They should be here if your move/copy was successful. Are they showing up in the Git pane with questions marks? They should be appearing as new untracked files. 17.4 Stage and commit Commit your files to this repo. How? Click the “Git” tab in upper right pane Check “Staged” box for all files you want to commit. Default: stage it. When to reconsider: this will all go to GitHub. So do consider if that is appropriate for each file. You can absolutely keep a file locally, without committing it to the Git repo and sending to GitHub. Just let it sit there in your Git pane, without being staged. No harm will be done. If this is a long-term situation, list the file in .gitignore. If you’re not already in the Git pop-up, click “Commit” Type a message in “Commit message”, such as “init”. Click “Commit” 17.5 Push your local changes to GitHub Click the green “Push” button to send your local changes to GitHub. You should see some message along these lines. [master dc671f0] blah 3 files changed, 22 insertions(+) create mode 100644 .gitignore create mode 100644 myrepo.Rproj 17.6 Confirm the local change propagated to the GitHub remote Go back to the browser. I assume we’re still viewing your new GitHub repo. Refresh. You should see all the project files you committed there. If you click on “commits,” you should see one with the message “init”. 17.7 The end Now just … repeat. Do work somewhere. Commit it. Push it or pull it depending on where you did it, but get local and remote “synced up”. Repeat. "],

This is less desirable for a novice because it involves command line Git. You can’t stay within RStudio. 18.1 Make or verify an RStudio Project We assume you’ve got your existing R project isolated in a directory on your computer. If it’s not already an RStudio Project, make it so: Create a new RStudio project: File &gt; New Project &gt; Existing Directory. Yes: “Open in new session”. If it’s already an RStudio Project, launch it. 18.2 Make or verify a Git repo You should be in RStudio now, in your project. Is it already a Git repository?

We discuss how to keep the intermediate Markdown file, the figures, and what to commit to Git and push to GitHub. If GitHub is the primary venue, we render directly to GitHub-flavored markdown and never create HTML. Here is the official R Markdown documentation: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com 19.1 Hello World We’ll practice with RStudio’s boilerplate R Markdown document. Launch RStudio in a Project that is a Git repo that is connected to a GitHub repo. We are modelling “walk before you run” here. It is best to increase complexity in small increments. We test our system’s ability to render the “hello world” of R Markdown documents before we muddy the waters with our own, probably buggy, documents. Do this: File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown … Give it an informative title. This will appear in the document but does not necessarily have anything to do with the file’s name. But the title and filename should be related! Why confuse yourself? The title is for human eyeballs, so it can contain spaces and punctuation. The filename is for humans and computers, so it should have similar words in it but no spaces and no punctuation. Accept the default Author or edit if you wish. Accept the default output format of HTML. Click OK. Save this document to a reasonable filename and location. The filename should end in .Rmd or .rmd. Save in the top-level of this RStudio project and Git repository, that is also current working directory. Trust me on this and do this for a while. You might want to commit here. So you can see what’s about to change … Click on “Knit HTML” or do File &gt; Knit Document. RStudio should display a preview of the resulting HTML. Also look at the file browser. You should see the R Markdown document, i.e. foo.Rmd AND the resulting HTML foo.html. Congratulations, you’ve just made your first reproducible report with R Markdown. You might want to commit here. 19.2 Push to GitHub Push the current state to GitHub. Go visit it in the browser. Do you see the new files? An R Markdown document and the associated HTML? Visit both in the browser. Verify this: Rmd is quite readable. But the output is obviously not there. HTML is ugly. 19.3 Output format Do you really want HTML? Do you only want HTML? If so, you can skip this step! The magical process that turns your R Markdown to HTML is like so: foo.Rmd --&gt; foo.md --&gt; foo.html. Note the intermediate markdown, foo.md. By default RStudio discards this, but you might want to hold on to that markdown. Why? GitHub gives very special treatment to markdown files. They are rendered in an almost HTML-like way. This is great because it preserves all the charms of plain text but gives you a pseudo-webpage for free when you visit the file in the browser. In contrast, HTML is rendered as plain text on GitHub and you’ll have to take special measures to see it the way you want. In many cases, you only want the markdown. In that case, we switch the output format to github_document. This means render will be foo.Rmd --&gt; foo.md, where foo.md is GitHub-flavored markdown. If you still want the HTML but also the intermediate markdown, there’s a way to request that too. Output format is one of the many things we can control in the YAML frontmatter – the text at the top of your file between leading and trailing lines of ---. You can make some changes via the RStudio IDE: click on the “gear” in the top bar of the source editor, near the “Knit HTML” button. Select “Output options” and go to the Advanced tab and check “Keep markdown source file.” Your YAML should now look more like this: --- title: &quot;Something fascinating&quot; author: &quot;Jenny Bryan&quot; date: &quot;2016-09-14&quot; output: html_document: keep_md: true --- You should have gained the line keep_md: true. You can also simply edit the file yourself to achieve this. In fact this hand-edit is necessary if you want to keep only markdown and get GitHub-flavored markdown. In that case, make your YAML look like this: --- title: &quot;Something fascinating&quot; author: &quot;Jenny Bryan&quot; date: &quot;2016-09-14&quot; output: github_document --- Save! You might want to commit here. Render via “Knit HTML” button. Now revisit the file browser. In addition to foo.Rmd, you should now see foo.md. If there are R chunks that make figures, the usage of markdown output formats will also cause those figure files to be left behind in a sensibly named sub-directory, foo_files. If you commit and push foo.md and everything inside foo_files, then anyone with permission to view your GitHub repo can see a decent-looking version of your report. If your output format is html_document, you should still see foo.html. If your output format is github_document and you see foo.html, that’s leftover from earlier experiments. Delete that. It will only confuse you later. You might want to commit here. 19.4 Push to GitHub Push the current state to GitHub. Go visit it in the browser. Do you see the modifications and new file(s)? Your Rmd should be modified (the YAML frontmatter changed). And you should have gained at least, the associated markdown file. Visit the markdown file and compare to our previous HTML. Do you see how the markdown is much more useful on GitHub? Internalize that. 19.5 Put your stamp on it Select everything but the YAML frontmatter and … delete it! Write a single English sentence. Insert an empty R chunk, via the “Chunk” menu in upper right of source editor or with corresponding keyboard shortcut. ```{r} ## insert your brilliant WORKING code here ``` Insert 1 to 3 lines of functioning code that begin the task at hand. “Walk through” and run those lines using the “Run” button or the corresponding keyboard shortcut. You MUST make sure your code actually works! Satisfied? Save! You might want to commit here. Now render the whole document via “Knit HTML.” Voilà! You might want to commit here. 19.6 Develop your report In this incremental manner, develop your report. Add code to this chunk. Refine it. Add new chunks. Go crazy! But keep running the code “manually” to make sure it works. If it doesn’t work with you babysitting it, I can guarantee you it will fail, in a more spectacular and cryptic way, when run at arms-length via “Knit HTML” or rmarkdown::render(). Clean out your workspace and restart R and re-run everything periodically, if things get weird. There are lots of chunk menu items and keyboard shortcuts to accelerate this workflow. Render the whole document often to catch errors when they’re easy to pinpoint and fix. Save often and commit every time you reach a point that you’d like as a “fall back” position. You’ll develop your own mojo soon, but this should give you your first successful R Markdown experience. 19.7 Publish your report If you’ve been making HTML, you can put that up on the web somewhere, email to your collaborator, whatever. No matter what, technically you can publish this report merely by pushing a rendered version to GitHub. However, certain practices make this effort at publishing more satisfying for your audience. Here are two behaviors I find very frustrating: “Here is my code. Behold.” This is when someone only pushes their source, i.e. R Markdown or R code AND they want other people to look at their “product”. The implicit assumption is that target audience will download code and run it. Sometimes the potential payoff simply does not justify this effort. “Here is my HTML. Behold.” This is when someone doesn’t bother to edit the default output format and accepts HTML only. What am I supposed to do with HTML on GitHub? Creating, committing, and pushing markdown is a very functional, lighweight publishing strategy. Use output: github_document or keep_md: true if output is html_document. In both cases, it is critical to also commit and push everything inside foo_files. Now people can visit and consume your work like any other webpage. This is (sort of) another example of keeping things machine- and human-readable, which is bliss. By making foo.Rmd available, others can see and run your actual code. By sharing foo.md and/or foo.html, others can casually browse your end product and decide if they even want to bother. 19.8 HTML on GitHub HTML files, such as foo.html, are not immediately useful on GitHub (though your local versions are easily viewable). Visit one and you’ll see the raw HTML. Yuck. But there are ways to get a preview: such as https://rawgit.com or http://htmlpreview.github.io. Expect some pain with HTML files inside private repos. When it becomes vital for the whole world to see proper HTML in its full glory, it’s time to use a more sophisticated web publishing strategy. I have more general ideas about how to make a GitHub repo function as a website. 19.9 Troubleshooting Make sure RStudio and the rmarkdown package (and its dependencies) are up-to-date. In case of catastrophic failure to render R Markdown, consider that your software may be too old. R Markdown has been developing rapidly (written 2015-09), so you need a very current version of RStudio and rmarkdown to enjoy all the goodies we describe in this course. Get rid of your .Rprofile, at least temporarily. I have found that a “mature” .Rprofile that has accumulated haphazardly over the years can cause trouble. Specifically, if you’ve got anything in there relating to knitr, markdown, rmarkdown and RStudio stuff, it may be preventing the installation or usage of the most recent goodies (see above). Comment the whole file out or rename it something else and relaunch or even re-install RStudio. Insert a chunk in your .Rmd document so that it renders even when there are errors. Some errors are easier to diagnose if you can execute specific R statements during rendering and leave more evidence behind for forensic examination. Put this chunk: ```{r setup, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE} knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE) ``` near the top of your R Markdown document if you want to soldier on through errors, i.e. turn foo.Rmd into foo.md and/or foo.html no matter what. This is also helpful if you are writing a tutorial and want to demo code that throws an error. You might want to keep this as an RStudio snippet for easy insertion. Tolerate errors in one specific chunk. If it’s undesirable to globally accept errors, you can still do this for a specific chunk like so: ```{r wing-and-a-prayer, error = TRUE} ## your sketchy code goes here ;) ``` Check your working directory. It’s going to break your heart as you learn how often your mistakes are really mundane and basic. Ask me how I know. When things go wrong consider: What is the working directory? Is that file I want to read/write actually where I think it is? Drop these commands into R chunks to check the above: getwd() will display working directory at run time. If you monkeyed around with working directory with, e.g., the mouse, maybe it’s set to one place for your interactive development and another when “Knit HTML” takes over? list.files() will list the files in working directory. Is the file you want even there? Don’t try to change working directory within an R Markdown document. Just don’t. That is all. Don’t be in a hurry to create a complicated sub-directory structure. RStudio/knitr/rmarkdown (which bring you the “Knit HTML” button) are rather opinionated about the working directory being set to the .Rmd file’s location and about all files living together in one big happy directory. This can all be worked around. But not today. "],
["r-test-drive.html", "20 Render an R script 20.1 Morph R Markdown into a renderable R script 20.2 Write a render-ready R script", " 20 Render an R script An underappreciated fact is that much of what you can do with R Markdown, you can also do with an R script. If you’re in analysis mode and want a report as a side effect, write an R script. If you’re writing a report with a lot of R code in it, write Rmd. In either case, render to markdown and/or HTML to communicate with other humans beings. In R markdown, prose is top-level and code is tucked into chunks. In R scripts, code is top-level and prose is tucked into comments. You will use #' to request that certain comments appear as top-level prose in the rendered output. You will continue to specify things like the output format via YAML at the top of the file. This will need to be commented with #'. 20.1 Morph R Markdown into a renderable R script Get yourself a working R Markdown file, such as the one you made in your Rmd test drive. Or use the boilerplate Rmd document RStudio makes with File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown …. Save the file as foo.R, as opposed to foo.Rmd. Yes, for a brief moment, you will have R Markdown saved as an R script, but that won’t be true for long. Transform the Rmd to R: Anything that’s not R code? Like the YAML and the English prose? Protect it with roxygen-style comments: start each line with #'. Anything that’s R code? Let it exist “as is” as top-level code. That means you’ll need to change the syntax of R chunk headers like so: Before: ```{r setup, include = FALSE} After: #+ r setup, include = FALSE Replace the leading backticks and opening curly brace with #+. Delete the trailing curly brace. Delete the 3 backticks that end each chunk. Render the R script through one of these methods: Click on the “notebook” icon in RStudio to “Compile Report”. In RStudio, do File &gt; Knit Document. In R, do rmarkdown::render(&quot;foo.R&quot;). You’ll get a markdown and/or HTML report, just as with R Markdown. If you’re having trouble making all the necessary changes and you’re frustrated, see below for an example you can copy and paste. All the workflow tips from the Rmd test drive apply here: when you script an analysis, render it to markdown, commit the .R, the .md, any associated figures, and push to GitHub. Collaborators can see your code but also browse the result without running it. This makes the current state of your analysis accessible to someone who does not even run R or who wants to take a quick look at things from a cell phone or while on vacation. 20.2 Write a render-ready R script Instead of morphing an R Markdown file, let’s create a render-ready R script directly. Create a new R script and copy/paste this code into it. #&#39; Here&#39;s some prose in a very special comment. Let&#39;s summarize the built-in #&#39; dataset `VADeaths`. ## here is a regular code comment, that will remain as such summary(VADeaths) #&#39; Here&#39;s some more prose. I can use usual markdown syntax to make things #&#39; **bold** or *italics*. Let&#39;s use an example from the `dotchart()` help to #&#39; make a Cleveland dot plot from the `VADeaths` data. I even bother to name #&#39; this chunk, so the resulting PNG has a decent name. #+ dotchart dotchart(VADeaths, main = &quot;Death Rates in Virginia - 1940&quot;) Render the R script through one of these methods: Click on the “notebook” icon in RStudio to “Compile Report”. In RStudio, do File &gt; Knit Document. In R, do rmarkdown::render(&quot;YOURSCRIPT.R&quot;). Revel in your attractive looking report with almost zero effort! Seriously, all you had to do was think about when to use special comments #' in order to promote that to nicely rendered text. Drawing on the workflow tips in Rmd test drive, let’s add some YAML frontmatter, properly commented with #', and request the github_document. Here’s the whole script again: #&#39; --- #&#39; title: &quot;R scripts can be rendered!&quot; #&#39; author: &quot;Jenny Bryan&quot; #&#39; date: &quot;`r format(Sys.Date())`&quot; #&#39; output: github_document #&#39; --- #&#39; #&#39; Here&#39;s some prose in a very special comment.

One of my favorite aspects of GitHub is the ability to inspect a repository’s files in a browser. Certain practices make browsing more rewarding and can postpone the day when you must create a proper website for a project. Perhaps indefinitely. 21.1 Be savvy about your files Keep files in the plainest, web-friendliest form that is compatible with your main goals. Plain text is the very best. GitHub offers special handling for certain types of files: Markdown files, which may be destined for conversion into, e.g., HTML Markdown files named README.md HTML files, often the result of compiling Markdown files Source code, such as .R files Delimited files, such as CSVs and TSVs PNG files 21.2 Get over your hang ups re: committing derived products Let’s acknowledge the discomfort some people feel about putting derived products under version control. Specifically, if you’ve got an R Markdown document foo.Rmd, it can be knit() to produce the intermediate product foo.md, which can be converted to the ultimate output foo.html. Which of those files are you “allowed” to put under version control? Source-is-real hardliners will say only foo.Rmd but pragmatists know this can be a serious bummer in real life. Just because I can rebuild everything from scratch, it doesn’t mean I want to. The taboo of keeping derived products under version control originates from compilation of binary executables from source. Software built on a Mac would not work on Windows and so it made sense to keep these binaries out of the holy source code repository. Also, you could assume the people with access to the repository have the full development stack and relish opportunities to use it. None of these arguments really apply to the foo.Rmd --&gt; foo.md --&gt; foo.html workflow. We don’t have to blindly follow traditions from the compilation domain! In fact, looking at the diffs for foo.md or foo-figure-01.png can be extremely informative. This is also true in larger data analytic projects projects after a make clean; make all operation. By looking at the diffs in the downstream products, you often catch unexpected changes. This can tip you off to changes in the underlying data and/or the behavior of packages you depend on. This chapter explores cool things GitHub can do with various file types, if they happen to end up in your repo. I won’t ask you how they got there. 21.3 Markdown You will quickly discover that GitHub renders Markdown files very nicely. By clicking on foo.md, you’ll get a decent preview of foo.html. Yay! You should read GitHub’s own guide on how to leverage automatic Markdown rendering. Exploit this aggressively. Make Markdown your default format for narrative text files and use them liberally to embed notes to yourself and others in a repository hosted on Github. It’s an easy way to get pseudo-webpages inside a project “for free”. You may never even compile these files to HTML explicitly; in many cases, the HTML preview offered by GitHub is all you ever need. What does this mean for R Markdown files? Keep intermediate Markdown. Or only render to Markdown. Commit both foo.Rmd and foo.md, even if you choose to .gitignore the final foo.html. From September 2014, GitHub renders R Markdown files nicely, like Markdown, and with proper syntax highlighting, which is great. But, of course, the code blocks just sit there un-executed, so my advice about keeping intermediate Markdown still holds. You want YAML frontmatter that looks something like this for .Rmd: --- title: &quot;Something fascinating&quot; author: &quot;Jenny Bryan&quot; date: &quot;`r format(Sys.Date())`&quot; output: html_document: keep_md: TRUE --- or like this for .R: #&#39; --- #&#39; title: &quot;Something fascinating&quot; #&#39; author: &quot;Jenny Bryan&quot; #&#39; date: &quot;`r format(Sys.Date())`&quot; #&#39; output: #&#39; html_document: #&#39; keep_md: TRUE #&#39; --- In RStudio, when editing .Rmd, click on the gear next to “Knit HTML” for YAML authoring help. As of early 2016, rmarkdown offers a custom output format for GitHub-flavored markdown, github_document. Read about R Markdown workflows for explicit examples of how to use this. For a quick, stand-alone document that doesn’t fit neatly into a repository or project (yet), make it a Gist. Example: Hadley Wickham’s advice on what you need to do to become a data scientist. Gists can contain multiple files, so you can still provide the R script or R Markdown source and the resulting Markdown, as I’ve done in this write-up of Twitter-sourced tips for cross-tabulation. 21.4 README.md You probably already know that GitHub renders README.md at the top-level of your repo as the de facto landing page. This is analogous to what happens when you point a web browser at a directory instead of a specific web page: if there is a file named index.html, that’s what the server will show you by default. On GitHub, files named README.md play exactly this role for directories in your repo. Implication: for any logical group of files or mini project-within-your-project, create a sub-directory in your repository. And then create a README.md file to annotate these files, collect relevant links, etc. Now when you navigate to the sub-directory on GitHub the nicely rendered README.md will simply appear. Some repositories consist solely of README.md. Examples: Jeff Leek’s write-ups on How to share data with a statistician or Developing R packages. I am becoming a bigger fan of README-only repos than gists because repo issues trigger notifications, whereas comments on gists do not. If you’ve got a directory full of web-friendly figures, such as PNGs, you can use code like this to generate a README.md for a quick DIY gallery, as Karl Broman has done with his FruitSnacks. I have also used this device to share Keynote slides on GitHub (mea culpa!). Export them as PNGs images and throw ’em into a README gallery: slides on file organization and some on file naming. 21.5 Finding stuff OK these are pure GitHub tips but if you’ve made it this far, you’re obviously a keener. Press t to activate the file finder whenever you’re in a repo’s file and directory view. AWESOME, especially when there are files tucked into lots of subdirectories. Press y to get a permanent link when you’re viewing a specific file. Watch what changes in the URL. This is important if you are about to link to a file or to specific lines. Otherwise your links will break easily in the future. If the file is deleted or renamed or if lines get inserted or deleted, your links will no longer point to what you intended. Use y to get links that include a specific commit in the URL. 21.6 HTML If you have an HTML file in a GitHub repository, simply visiting the file shows the raw HTML. Here’s a nice ugly example: https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/bit003_api-key-env-var.html No one wants to look at that. You can provide this URL to rawgit.com to serve this HTML more properly and get a decent preview. You can form two different types of URLs with rawgit.com: For sharing low-traffic, temporary examples or demos with small numbers of people, do this: https://rawgit.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/master/bit003_api-key-env-var.html Basically: replace https://github.com/ with https://rawgit.com/ For use on production websites with any amount of traffic, do this: https://cdn.rawgit.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/master/bit003_api-key-env-var.html Basically: replace https://github.com/ with https://cdn.rawgit.com/ This sort of enhanced link might be one of the useful things to put in a README.md or other Markdown file in the repo. You may also want to check out this Chrome extension or GitHub &amp; BitBucket HTML Preview, though recently I’ve more success with rawgit.com. Sometimes including HTML files will cause GitHub to think that your R repository is HTML. Besides being slightly annoying, this can make it difficult for people to find your work if they are searching specifically for R repos. You can exclude these files or directories from GitHub’s language statistics by adding a .gitattributes file that marks them as ‘documentation’ rather than code. See an example here. 21.7 Source code You will notice that GitHub does automatic syntax highlighting for source code. For example, notice the coloring of this R script. The file’s extension is the primary determinant for if/how syntax highlighting will be applied. You can see information on recognized languages, the default extensions and more at github/linguist. You should be doing it anyway, but let this be another reason to follow convention in your use of file extensions. Note you can click on “Raw” in this context as well, to get just the plain text and nothing but the plain text. 21.8 Delimited files GitHub will nicely render tabular data in the form of .csv (comma-separated) and .tsv (tab-separated) files. You can read more in the blog post announcing this feature in August 2013 or in this GitHub help page. Advice: take advantage of this! If something in your repo can be naturally stored as delimited data, by all means, do so. Make the comma or tab your default delimiter and use the file suffixes GitHub is expecting. I have noticed that GitHub is more easily confused than R about things like quoting, so always inspect the GitHub-rendered .csv or .tsv file in the browser. You may need to do light cleaning to get the automagic rendering to work properly. Think of it as yet another way to learn about imperfections in your data. Here’s an example of a tab delimited file on GitHub: lotr_clean.tsv, originally found here (nope, IBM shut down manyeyes July 2015). Note you can click on “Raw” in this context as well, to get just the plain text and nothing but the plain text. 21.9 PNGs PNG is the “no brainer” format in which to store figures for the web. But many of us like a vector-based format, such as PDF, for general purpose figures. Bottom line: PNGs will drive you less crazy than PDFs on GitHub. To reduce the aggravation around viewing figures in the browser, make sure to have a PNG version in the repo. Examples: This PNG figure just shows up in the browser A different figure stored as PDF produces the dreaded, annoying “View Raw” speed bump. You’ll have to click through and, on my OS + browser, wait for the PDF to appear in an external PDF viewer. 2015-06-19 update: since I first wrote this GitHub has elevated its treament of PDFs so YAY. It’s slow but it works. Hopefully we are moving towards a world where you can have “web friendly” and “vector” at the same time, without undue headaches. As of October 2014, GitHub provides enhanced viewing and diffing of SVGs. So don’t read this advice as discouraging SVGs. Make them! But consider keeping a PNG around as emergency back up for now. 21.10 Linking to a ZIP archive of your repo The browsability of GitHub makes your work accessible to people who care about your content but who don’t (yet) use Git themselves. What if such a person wants all the files? Yes, there is a clickable “Download ZIP” button offered by GitHub. But what if you want a link to include in an email or other document? If you add /archive/master.zip to the end of the URL for your repo, you construct a link that will download a ZIP archive of your repository. Click here to try this out on a very small repo: https://github.com/jennybc/lotr/archive/master.zip Go look in your downloads folder! 21.11 Links and embedded figures To link to another page in your repo, just use a relative link: [admin](courseAdmin/) will link to the courseAdmin/ directory inside the current directory. [admin](/courseAdmin/) will link to the top-level courseAdmin/ directory from any where in the repo The same idea also works for images. ![](image.png) will include image.png located in the current directory 21.12 Let people correct you on the internet They love that! You can create a link that takes people directly to an editing interface in the browser. Behind the scenes, assuming the clicker is signed into GitHub but is not you, this will create a fork in their account and send you a pull request. When I click the link below, I am able to actually commit directly to master for this repo. CLICK HERE to suggest an edit to this page! Here’s what that link looks like in the Markdown source: [CLICK HERE to suggest an edit to this page!](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/edit/master/bit006_github-browsability-wins.md) and here it is with placeholders: [INVITATION TO EDIT](&lt;URL to your repo&gt;/edit/master/&lt;path to your md file&gt;) AFAIK, to do that in a slick automatic way across an entire repo/site, you need to be using Jekyll or some other automated system.

What if you suspect you might want to propose a change to a repository? Then you should fork it, instead of clone it. 24.1 Fork then clone On GitHub, navigate to a repo of interest. In the upper right hand corner, click Fork. This creates a copy of the repo in your GitHub account and takes you there in the browser. Use the usual workflow (chapter 23) to clone this to your local machine. 24.2 Fork and pull Make your changes locally, commit, then push back to your fork. When/if you are ready to propose a change, you place a pull request from your fork on GitHub to the original repo owned by someone else. Here’s a sketch of how this looks: 24.3 Updating your fork It is harder to keep a fork updated than a clone. Why? Because the primary remote associated with your local is your fork. But you need to get the new commits from the repository you originally forked. You need to have more than one remote associated with your local repo.

It has been immortalized in an xkcd comic, so it must be ok: https://xkcd.com/1597/ http://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1597:_Git Basic idea: Commit early and often. Push to a remote, like GitHub, often. The state of things on GitHub is your new “worst case scenario”. If you really screw things up locally, copy all the files (or the ones that have changed) to a safe place. Usually your files are JUST FINE. But it is easy to goof up the Git infrastructure when you’re new at this. And it can be hard to get that straightened out on your own. Rename the existing local repo as a temporary measure, i.e. before you do something radical, like delete it. Clone the repo from GitHub to your local machine. You are back to a happy state. Copy all relevant files back over from your safe space. The ones whose updated state you need to commit. Stage and commit. Push. Carry on with your life.

If “YES go right back to the moment before I committed”: git reset --soft HEAD^. Your files will stay the same but the commit will be undone. Even your staged changes will be restored. If you just want to fiddle the most recent commit or its message, you can amend it. You can do this from RStudio! Make the change you want and amend the commit.

GOOD! Here’s a link to Contributors. BAD. You can see contributors in 2. Facts and vocabulary Each chapter is a file. These files should begin with the chapter title using a level-one header, e.g., # Chapter Title. A chapter can be made up of sections, indicated by lower-level headers, e.g., ## A section within the chapter. There are three ways to address a section when creating links within your book: Explicit identifier: In # My header {#foo} the explicit identifier is foo. Automatically generated identifier: my-header is the auto-identifier for # My header. Pandoc creates auto-identifiers according to rules laid out in Extension: auto_identifiers. The header text, e.g., My header be used verbatim as an implicit header reference. See Extension: implicit_header_references for more. All 3 forms can be used to create cross-references but you build the links differently. Advantage of explicit identification: You are less likely to update the section header and then forget to make matching edits to references elsewhere in the book. How to make text-based links using explicit identifiers, automatic identifiers, and implicit references: Use implicit reference alone to get a link where the text is exactly the section header: [Introduce yourself to Git] Introduce yourself to Git [Success and operating systems] Success and operating systems You can provide custom text for the link with all 3 methods of addressing a section: Implicit header reference: [link text][Recommended Git clients] link text Explicit identifier: [hello git!

["shell.html", "A The shell A.1 What is the shell? A.2 Starting the shell A.3 Using the shell A.4 Note for Windows users", " A The shell Even if you do most of your Git operations via a client, such as RStudio or GitKraken, you must sometimes work in the shell. As you get more comfortable with Git, you might prefer to do more and more via the command line. A.1 What is the shell? The shell (or bash or terminal or Command Prompt on Windows) is a program on your computer whose job is to run other programs, rather than do calculations itself. The shell is a very old program and in a time before the mouse it was the only way to interact with a computer. It is still extremely popular among programmers because it is very fast, concise, and is particularly powerful at automating repetitive tasks. Here we use the shell for quite modest goals: to navigate the file system, confirm the present working directory, configure Git, and configure Git remotes. A.2 Starting the shell In RStudio, go to Tools &gt; Shell. This should take you to the shell (on Mac: Terminal, on Windows: GitBash or equivalent). It should be a simple blinking cursor, waiting for input and look similar to this (white text on black background, or black text on white background): A.3 Using the shell The most basic commands are listed below: pwd (print working directory). Shows directory or “folder” you are currently operating in. This is not necessarily the same as the R working directory you get from getwd(). ls (list files). Shows the files in the current working directory. This is equivalent to looking at the files in your Finder/Explorer/File Manager. Use ls -a to also list hidden files, such as .Rhistory and .git. cd (change directory). Allows you to navigate through your directories by changing the shell’s working directory. You can navigate like so: go to subdirectory foo of current working directory: cd foo go to parent of current working directory: cd .. go to your “home” directory: cd ~ or simply cd go to directory using absolute path, works regardless of your current working directory: cd /home/my_username/Desktop. Windows uses a slightly different syntax with the slashes between the folder names reversed, \\, e.g. cd C:\\Users\\MY_USERNAME\\Desktop. Pro tip 1: Dragging and dropping a file or folder into the terminal window will paste the absolute path into the window. Pro tip 2: Use the tab key to autocomplete unambiguous directory and file names. Hit tab twice to see all ambiguous options. Use arrow-up and arrow-down to repeat previous commands. Or search for previous commands with CTRL + r. A few Git commands: git status is the most used git command and informs you of your current branch, any changes or untracked files, and whether you are in sync with your remotes. git remote -v lists all remotes. Very useful for making sure git knows about your remote and that the remote address is correct. git remote add origin GITHUB_URL adds the remote GITHUB_URL with nickname origin. git remote set-url origin GITHUB_URL changes the remote url of origin to GITHUB_URL. This way you can fix typos in the remote url. we should add more A.4 Note for Windows users On Windows, the program that runs the shell is called Command Prompt or cmd.exe. Unfortunately, the default Windows shell does not support all the commands that other operating systems do. This is where GitBash comes in handy: it installs a light version of a shell that does support all the above commands. When you access the shell through RStudio, RStudio actually tries to open GitBash if it can find it, but it will open the default Windows Command Prompt if GitBash is not found. If you get an error message such as 'pwd' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. from any of the previous commands, that means that RStudio could not find GitBash. The most likely cause of this is that you did not install git using the recommended method from this book, so try re-installing git. "],
["github-pat.html", "B GitHub Personal Access Tokens B.1 GitHub API B.2 How do you authenticate yourself? B.3 Step-by-step B.4 A note about security B.5 Why .Renviron instead of bash config?", " B GitHub Personal Access Tokens If you Git push or pull via the command line, you can avoid the constant authentication challenge by caching your username and password for HTTPS access or by setting up SSH keys. This includes any Git operations done by RStudio on your behalf. But for some operations you must call the GitHub API (Application Programming Iinterface). And this requires that you authenticate yourself in a different way. B.1 GitHub API The first reason most people need GitHub API access is because they want to use the devtools package. It is popular for the devtools::install_github() function to install directly from GitHub. This is in contrast to installing a package from CRAN via install.packages(). Why install from GitHub instead of CRAN? The package is developed on GitHub and you prefer the development version because it has some features or bug fixes not yet on CRAN. You contribute to or use R packages that are in private repositories on GitHub (or GitHub Enterprise). CRAN is not an option. Other reasons to call the GitHub API include doing almost anything you might do in the browser, especially if you need to do it on a grand scale, i.e., create repositories or users or fetch data. I recommend the gh package for this. Which you must install from GitHub! B.2 How do you authenticate yourself? With access via API, what plays the role of the HTTPS username/password or SSH keys? For the GitHub API, we use a personal access token (PAT), which is a convention followed by many other APIs. You will need to: Obtain a PAT. This is done in the browser. Store it so packages like devtools can find it and use it on your behalf. The path of least resistance is to define it in your .Renviron file as the environment variable named GITHUB_PAT. B.3 Step-by-step Login to your GitHub account. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens. “Generate new token”. Give it a nickname that reminds you of the intended purpose, e.g., “devtools”. Pick scopes that confer the privileges you need. When in doubt, check the repo scope, which is required for typical devtools operations. There used to be a set of default scopes, but that no longer appears to be true. After you click “Generate token”, the token will be displayed. It’s a string of 40 random letters and digits. This is the last time you will see it SO COPY IT TO THE CLIPBOARD. Leave this window open until you’re done. If you somehow goof this up, just generate a new one and try again. Put your PAT in your .Renviron file. Have a line that looks like this: GITHUB_PAT=8c70fd8419398999c9ac5bacf3192882193cadf2 but with your PAT instead of mine. Don’t worry, I’ve revoked this one! This file should live in your home directory. Not sure what that is? In R, do: normalizePath(&quot;~/&quot;) If you have no idea how to do any of this, here’s one way from R: cat(&quot;8c70fd8419398999c9ac5bacf3192882193cadf2\\n&quot;, file = file.path(normalizePath(&quot;~/&quot;), &quot;.Renviron&quot;), append = TRUE) but with your PAT instead of mine. Here’s another way with RStudio (or other text editor): Do File &gt; New File &gt; Text file. Create a line like this: GITHUB_PAT=8c70fd8419398999c9ac5bacf3192882193cadf2 Put a line break at the end! If you’re using an editor that shows line numbers, there should be two lines, where the second one is empty. Save in your home directory with the filename .Renviron. If questioned, YES you do want to use a filename that begins with a dot .. Note that, by default, dotfiles are hidden in RStudio, but .Renviron should always be visible and therefore easy to edit in the future. Restart R (Session &gt; Restart R in the RStudio menu bar), as environment variables are loaded from .Renviron only at the start of an R session. Check that the PAT is now available like so: Sys.getenv(&quot;GITHUB_PAT&quot;) You should see your PAT print to screen. Now commands you run from the devtools package, which consults GITHUB_PAT by default, will be able to access private GitHub repositories to which you have access, and you can install them with devtools::install_github('username/reponame'). B.4 A note about security Many R packages that access web services, such as those maintained by rOpenSci, give the option of storing API “tokens” or “keys” as environment variables in your .Renviron file. These tokens and this file, should never be committed to GitHub, stored in Dropbox, or on any other online service. They should not appear in your code or code comments. This is one reason why this file is stored outside your project folder. These tokens can be used to access your accounts and wreak all kinds of havoc. If you mistakenly share your tokens, log into the relevant site via the browser, revoke the compromised token, and generate a new one. B.5 Why .Renviron instead of bash config? FAQ: Why define this environment variable via .Renviron instead of in .bash_profile or .bashrc?* Because there are many combinations of OS and ways of running R where the .Renviron approach “just works” and the bash stuff does not. When R is a child process of, say, Emacs or RStudio, you can’t always count on environment variables being passed to R. Put them in an R-specific start-up file and save yourself some grief. "],
